# appium_test_framework
The goal of this framework is to set up an appium test framework to showcase how a good framework should look like.

## We will be using:
- Java-Maven - to write our code and build our framework
- TestNG - to test our appium code
- a Sample apk - to explore some appium features for android testing
- a Sample ipa - to explore some appium features for iOS testing
- Github Codespaces to write our code
- AWS Device Farm to run our code (optional)
- GitHub Actions to deploy (optional)

## Methodology
I will be writing down my thoughts in the code, and in text files to guide myself on the tasks that need to be completed, and in certain cases, why I made certain decisions
